    "Body": "I'm a bit miffed that those anti-Inslee <<people>> would go so far as to call our LORD AND SAVIOR JAY INSLEE a bad leader. All claims like this are simply absurd. Jay inslee has not only shown his STURDIENESS as a leader, but he has shown that he is MORE THAN WILLING to lead this state, nay, this kingdom of INSLEE forward. [paid for by inslee 4 prez 2020]"
